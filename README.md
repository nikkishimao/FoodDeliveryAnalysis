<h1>Data Warehouse: A Food Delivery Analysis</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This project focuses on analyzing and modeling food delivery operations using
transactional and behavioral data from a restaurant delivery platform. The dataset includes
detailed timestamps, customer information, restaurant interactions, delivery regions, and
payment transactions. By organizing this data into a dimensional model, we aim to support
efficient business intelligence reporting, performance monitoring, and operational decision-
making.
  
With Isha Kadam, Purtee Bhise, and Tharuni Tekula, we designed a comprehensive data warehouse that enables deeper insights into the customer journey, from placing an order to final delivery, as well as restaurant performance and driver efficiency across regions.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To develop a robust dimensional data model using the Kimball methodology that
supports multiple business processes.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>To design a Bus Matrix that clearly defines fact and dimension tables supporting use
cases such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Order placement and payment tracking</li>
      <li>Delivery efficiency and driver logistics</li>
      <li>Customer engagement and loyalty behavior</li>
      <li>Restaurant operational performance</li>
      <li>Regional analysis of delivery demand and timing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Value</h2>

<p>This project empowers stakeholders with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Insights:</strong>Understand ordering behavior, identify loyal customers, and measure retention efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Optimization:</strong>Analyze delivery performance and time splits to reduce delivery delays and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Restaurant Management:</strong>Track restaurant throughput, cancellation rates, and peak order times to optimize staffing and inventory.</li>
  <li><strong>Driver Efficieny:</strong>Monitor delivery times by driver and region to improve routing and resource allocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong>Support marketing and operations teams with data-driven decisions for promotions, discounts, and geographic expansion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/nikkishimao/FoodDeliveryAnalysis/blob/13ff8ed42a2acee3263d4346b1a7c7d89e458b30/code/data.csv">Data Used</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Source Data Description</h3>
<p>The dataset consists of transactional and operational data related to a food delivery platform, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Orders:</strong>Order IDs, timestamps, order totals, discounts, tips, refund amounts, and ASAP vs. scheduled flags.</li>
  <li><strong>Customers:</strong>Customer IDs, demographics, loyalty status, total orders, and total spend.</li>
  <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong>Restaurant IDs, performance metrics such as order volume, delivery times, and cancellations.</li>
  <li><strong>Payments:</strong>Payment amounts, discounts, tips, and refund details.</li>
  <li><strong>Deliveries:</strong>Delivery IDs, timestamps for key delivery events, driver assignment, and total delivery duration.</li>
  <li><strong>Drivers:</strong>Driver IDs, associated delivery records, and delivery performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Regions/Locations:</strong>Delivery regions associated with orders, allowing geographic performance analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Types:</strong>Classification of orders as ASAP or Scheduled for fulfillment timing analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Profiling Insights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Missing values were identified in specific columns (e.g., some refund amounts and
timestamps).</li>
  <li>The is_asap column was reviewed to distinguish between scheduled and ASAP orders.</li>
  <li>Date and time fields were converted into standard formats for consistency across datasets.</li>
  <li>Duplicates were minimal and handled during the ETL stage.</li>
  <li>Key dimensions (such as customer, restaurant, and driver) were checked for unique
identifiers to ensure referential integrity in fact table joins.</li>
  <li>Categorical fields (e.g., loyalty status, order type) were standardized for analysis and
visualization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges and Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incomplete or inconsistent data:</strong> Some columns (like delivery times, refunded amounts, or driver timestamps) may have missing or inconsistent values, impacting accuracy in analytics.</li>
  <li><strong>Ambiguity in certain fields:</strong> Fields like is_ASAP required assumptions due to a lack of a clear order_type column.</li>
  <li><strong>Data normalization needs:</strong> Fields like locations and time formats required
transformation or standardization before modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>ETL Complexity:</strong> Ensuring consistent keys and grain across multiple fact tables and aligning with dimensional tables added complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance optimization:</strong> As data volume grows, query speed and dashboard
performance may require further tuning.</li>
  <li><strong>Surrogate key generation:</strong> Needed for all dimension tables and fact relationships, requiring consistent ETL logic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Naming Conventions and Standards</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Table naming:
    <ul>
      <li>Prefix all fact tables with fact_ (e.g., fact_orders)</li>
      <li>Prefix all dimension tables with dim_ (e.g., dim_customer)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Column naming:
    <ul>
      <li>Use camelCase for all column names (e.g., orderId, customerKey)</li>
      <li>Surrogate keys end with Key (e.g., customerKey, regionKey)</li>
      <li>Business keys match source naming or follow logical descriptions (e.g.,
customerId, orderTotal)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Key and Relationships:
    <ul>
      <li>Surrogate keys used as primary keys in dimension tables</li>
      <li>Foreign keys in fact tables always reference the surrogate keys from dimension
tables</li>
      <li>All foreign keys are named consistently as dimensionNameKey (e.g.,
paymentKey, driverKey)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Warehouse Implementation</h2>
<h3>Technical Architectire</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Source: A CSV file named data.csv, which contains order-related data.</li>
  <li>ETL Script: A Python script that extracts data from the CSV, transforms it (cleans,
parses datetime, checks for missing data), and loads it into a MySQL-based data
warehouse.</li>
  <li>Target Data Warehouse: MySQL database (food_delivery_dw) containing dimension
and fact tables (dim_customer, dim_driver, dim_restaurant, dim_time, fact_orders).</li>
  <li>Libraries Used: pandas for data handling, numpy for NaN handling, datetime for
timestamp conversion, mysql.connector for DB interaction, tqdm for progress bars, and
logging for structured log output.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Pipeline Design (ETL/ELT)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extract:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The script reads in data from data.csv.</li>
      <li>Required columns are validated to ensure schema integrity.</li>
      <li>Missing values are replaced with None.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transform:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Datetime fields are parsed from custom 'DD HH:MM:SS' format to full datetime
objects</li>
      <li>Rows with critical missing datetime values are dropped.</li>
      <li>Data is type-cast (e.g., converting ID fields to integers, floats for monetary
amounts).</li>
      <li>Duplicates are avoided in dimensions by checking which IDs already exist in the
database.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Load:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Connects to MySQL and inserts unique values into dim_customer, dim_driver,
and dim_restaurant.</li>
      <li>Inserts detailed datetime breakdowns into dim_time.</li>
      <li>Inserts transactional data (e.g., order total, tip, refund) into fact_orders, linking to all relevant dimension tables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
